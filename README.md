# Sublime JSX
## A simple JSX syntax mode for Sublime Text.

### Credit
~~This repo is really just a "fork" of Timothy Yung's [repo](https://github.com/yungsters/sublime). @yungsters' repo was named Sublime, which would appear in Package Control as "Sublime", and seems to be a general place for Sublime config files. This new repo can exist solely as the home for the JSX syntax.~~

### Installation
~~Make sure you have [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) installed. Once installed, open Package Control or the Command Palette (Preferences > Package Control, or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>P</kbd> on Mac, respectively) and type `Add Repository` until the option appears. Hit enter, and in the (easy to miss!) input at the bottom of the screen, enter `https://github.com/masondesu/Sublime-JSX`.~~

~~Once you've add the repository to Package Control, in the Command Palette type `Install Package` and hit enter. Once the results appear, start typing `JSX` to find the package, hit enter and you're done.~~

### Usage
~~The syntax should automatically apply to `.js`, `.jsx`, and `.htc` files after restarting Sublime. You can manually set the syntax via the Command Palette by typing `set syntax jsx`.~~
